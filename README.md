# 🕹️ Reinforcement Learning with Q-Learning – CartPole

This project demonstrates how to implement a basic reinforcement learning agent using the **Q-Learning algorithm** to solve the `CartPole-v1` environment from OpenAI Gym.

The goal of the agent is to learn to balance a pole on a moving cart by choosing discrete actions (left or right) based on observed states.

## 🎯 Objective

To teach a simple RL agent how to:
- Maximize cumulative reward
- Learn from interaction with the environment
- Update its action-value function (Q-table) over episodes

This project covers:
- Environment setup using `gym`
- Implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm from scratch
- Training and evaluation of the agent
- Plotting performance curves
## 📁 File Structure

The project is implemented entirely in one notebook:

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

---

### 1. 📚 Importing Libraries

- `gym` – to load and interact with the `CartPole-v1` environment  
- `numpy` – for numeric operations and Q-table  
- `matplotlib.pyplot` – for visualizing the learning process  

---

### 2. 🏗️ Environment Initialization

- Initializes the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym.  
- Sets basic parameters like number of states and actions.  
- Discretizes the continuous state space to enable tabular Q-Learning.

---

### 3. ⚙️ Hyperparameters Setup

Defines the learning parameters for Q-Learning:
- `alpha` – learning rate  
- `gamma` – discount factor  
- `epsilon` – exploration factor (with decay)  
- Number of `episodes`, `bins`, and action space

---

### 4. 🧠 Q-Table Initialization

- Creates a Q-table with dimensions based on discretized state bins and number of actions.
- Initially filled with zeros.

---

### 5. 🏃‍♂️ Training Loop (Q-Learning)

The agent is trained over multiple episodes:
- For each step:
  - Observes the current state
  - Chooses an action using epsilon-greedy strategy
  - Receives a reward and new state
  - Updates the Q-value using the Bellman Equation:
  
    \[
    Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \cdot \left[r + \gamma \cdot \max_a Q(s', a) - Q(s, a)\right]
    \]
  
- Tracks rewards per episode

---

### 6. 📈 Performance Visualization

- Plots the total reward per episode to show learning progress over time.
- Demonstrates agent improvement through training.

---

### 7. 🎮 Optional Testing (Evaluation Run)

- Lets the trained agent run in the environment with `render()` enabled to visualize performance after training.
- Uses the learned Q-table without exploration (pure exploitation).
